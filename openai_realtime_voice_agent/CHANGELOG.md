# Changelog

All notable changes to this add-on. Newest first.

## 0.5.1

**Cost guard** (fork addition): every OpenAI response is now priced from the
API's own usage figures and logged (💰 lines), the day's running total
persists across restarts, web searches are counted, and a new optional
**`daily_budget_usd`** cap (⚙️ Advanced) refuses *new* conversations once the
day's estimated spend reaches it — in-flight conversations are never cut.
Estimates are deliberate upper bounds (all tokens priced at audio rates).

## 0.5.0

A big stable release: everything built and tested on the dev channel over the
past days. **Also update the Voice PE firmware** (v1.1.0 — one click in ESPHome
Builder) to get the full effect of the "stop" improvements; the two halves
work best together.

- **"Stop" now works through the whole reply AND the after-reply listening
  window.** The device detects the word more reliably, and the bridge treats
  it as authoritative: in-flight audio is discarded and an answer OpenAI had
  already started for the stop word itself is cancelled on arrival — no more
  "Okay, I'll be quiet" replies to your "stop".
- **Fixed: an answer could cut off mid-sentence, after which the assistant
  went deaf** until the next reconnect. Harmless protocol races (e.g. your
  sentence being split into two turns by a pause) no longer kill the session.
- **Fixed an audio race that could inject noise/hiss into replies** (firmware,
  paired with this release).
- **Mute behaves properly now** (firmware): the ring goes dark with red
  markers by the microphones, and muting also ends an open listening window
  immediately — both from Home Assistant and with the physical side switch.
- **The LED Ring switch in Home Assistant works again** (firmware): entity off
  = device dark at rest; entity on = the gentle "ready" pulse.
- **Completely reworked Configuration tab**: options grouped logically
  (Basics → Model & voice → Conversation → Web search → Audio →
  Home Assistant → Advanced), every description rewritten in plain practical
  language, and a full Dutch translation included (shown automatically when
  your HA is set to Dutch). Confusing or broken switches were removed; rarely
  needed expert fields stay hidden until you need them.
- **The add-on now has its own icon.**
- Friendlier defaults for new installs: follow-up mic delay 200 ms and
  playback buffer 150 ms. **Existing installs keep their saved values** — if
  yours still say 0, consider setting 200/150 manually (Conversation / Audio
  groups) for fewer ghost triggers and less crackle.

### Heads-up: the firmware stub template was improved

The per-device stub in ESPHome Builder used to reference the firmware in a
form that lets ESPHome **cache the downloaded YAML for a day** — clicking
Update shortly after a release could then silently rebuild yesterday's code.
The stub templates in the firmware repo are fixed; existing users can apply
the same fix once by replacing **only the `packages:` block** in their
device's YAML in ESPHome Builder (everything else — your name, secrets,
`dashboard_import` — stays exactly the same):

```yaml
packages:
  realtime:
    url: https://github.com/xandervanerven/home-assistant-voice-pe
    ref: main
    files: [home-assistant-voice.realtime.yaml]
    refresh: 0s
```

## 0.4.26

- **Web search is now ON by default**, using **gpt-5.5** (the best-quality search
  model), so the assistant can look things up online — weather, news, facts — out
  of the box. **Existing installs keep their saved setting**: if you had it off,
  switch `enable_web_search` on (and set `web_search_model` to `gpt-5.5`) in the
  add-on Configuration. The cheaper mini/nano models stay available.

## 0.4.25

- **Fix:** the first thing you said in the few seconds right after an automatic
  reconnect (e.g. after the 60-minute session cap) could be ignored
  (`conversation_already_has_active_response`). The reconnected session no longer
  creates a duplicate response, so that turn answers normally.

## 0.4.24

- **Renamed** to **OpenAI Realtime 2 Voice Agent**.
- Rewrote the store/info description and added a full **Documentation** tab
  (install steps, OpenAI key, Home Assistant MCP setup, recommended settings, web
  search, credits). Removed stale text from the original upstream client.
- Default system prompt is now an English, voice-tuned prompt (silent tool calls,
  varied confirmations, language pinning). Your own saved prompt is not changed.
- Default `follow_up_open_delay_ms` and `playback_prebuffer_ms` set to `0` (raise
  them if the device hears its own tail or you hear crackle).

## 0.4.23

- **Fix:** the 60-minute session cap sometimes left the session dead until a
  restart. It now reconnects automatically in all cases (both the keepalive-drop
  and the `session_expired` forms).

## 0.4.22

- **New options:** voice **speed** (0.25–1.5), **max reply length**
  (`max_output_tokens`), and **input noise reduction** (off / near-field /
  far-field). All default to current behaviour.

## 0.4.21

- Model, voice, web-search-model and transcription-model options are now
  **dropdowns** with the known-good values, each with a **custom** entry if you
  need a value not in the list.

## 0.4.20

- **New:** optional **web search**. Turn on `enable_web_search` to let the
  assistant look things up online (weather, news, facts). Uses your OpenAI key;
  off by default. Model configurable via `web_search_model` (default gpt-5.4-mini).

## 0.4.19

- Clarified the MCP option help text for both the built-in HA MCP Server and the
  unofficial ha-mcp add-on.

## 0.4.18

- **Fix:** removed a meaningless filler reply ("I'm ready to continue…") that could
  appear on the first turn of a session.

## 0.4.17

- **Fix:** cap restored conversation history (`max_context_messages`, default 12) to
  bound per-turn token cost and avoid hitting OpenAI's rate limit.

## 0.4.16

- **Fix:** the device no longer gets stuck blinking "thinking" after a turn-ending
  error (e.g. a rate limit) — it returns to idle so you can retry.

## 0.4.14

- **New:** `playback_prebuffer_ms` jitter buffer to reduce occasional crackle at the
  start of replies.

## 0.4.12 – 0.4.13

- **Fix:** "say stop, then immediately ask again → silence". Disabled the broken
  server-side audio truncation that wedged the next turn.

## 0.4.9 – 0.4.11

- **New:** auto-reconnect the OpenAI Realtime session when its connection drops
  (keepalive timeout / 60-minute cap), instead of going dead until a restart.
  Refined so a normal device disconnect doesn't trigger an unnecessary reconnect.

## 0.4.6 – 0.4.8

- **New:** configurable post-reply **follow-up listening window** (answer back
  without re-saying the wake word) + its open-delay, and per-option help text in the
  UI.
- **New:** the assistant's and user's transcripts are logged to the add-on log
  (`🤖 assistant:` / `🗣️ user:`).

## 0.4.0 – 0.4.4

- **Fix:** resample the device's 16 kHz mic to the 24 kHz OpenAI requires (garbled
  speech), and drop empty audio chunks.
- **New:** device **"stop"** interrupt now actually cancels the reply and clears
  buffered audio.

## 0.3.x

- Switched the target to **gpt-realtime-2**, pinned pipecat-ai 0.0.97, and tuned
  turn detection (semantic VAD), phase delivery to the device, and the startup
  sequence to stop double-responses. Made the disconnect tool and transcription
  model configurable.

## Earlier

- Initial pipecat + WebSocket implementation (forked from
  [fjfricke/ha-openai-realtime](https://github.com/fjfricke/ha-openai-realtime)).
